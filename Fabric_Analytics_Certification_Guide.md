- Implement **OneLake integration** for eventhouse and semantic models.

#### Transform Data

- Create views, functions, and stored procedures.
- Enrich data by adding new columns or tables.
- Implement a **star schema** for a lakehouse or warehouse.
- Denormalize data.
- Aggregate data.
- Merge or join data.
- Identify and resolve duplicate data, missing data, or null values.
- Convert column data types.
- Filter data.

#### Query and Analyze Data

- Select, filter, and aggregate data using the **Visual Query Editor**.
